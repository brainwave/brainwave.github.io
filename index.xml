      <description>The previous post featured on just getting a website up and running in hugo. This post focusses on customizing the website, to your liking and publishing it on github. There are three ways of accomplishing this in the documentation -
 Make a docs folder in your website root, change the publishDir option in your config to docs. Then create an empty git repo not named as per .github.io. It can be named anything else.</description>

      <description>This post explores how to go about building a website with Hugo, a static website generator. I found easy to get confused, even frustrated, while attempting to build my first real website. If you are like me and have never dabbled in web development before, this post is for you.
1. Overview and Workflow We are going to do the following in order -
 Install hugo Create an empty website Test our setup with local webserver Use a hugo theme Publish a sample website Customize our site  The docs are indeed quite sufficient for [1] through [5].</description>

      <description>Phew! I knew making a good website wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. But I had 0 clue it was this hard. Tl Dr; Its almost as hard as choosing a background for your phone.
You do, of course, have a full right to disagree. After all, even if you are a complete n00b like me in web dev, you must have created your first website in 15 minutes on wordpress. But thats the thing - its easy if you are using something like wordpress.</description>

      <description>The distinction between A type and B type people is real. I know, because for most of my living memory I have been a B Type person. While it might have its own advantages, the danger of being afflicted with laziness or complacence is all the more. Not to mention - you can easily go down the slippery slope of depression. Which then leads to lack of physical movement ( including not leaving your now shabby room for extended lengths of time ), and that feeds into a vicious cycle of wallowing in eternal misery.</description>

      <description>Hey guys! I am Brahm.
Mechanical engineer by education and roboticist by interest, things I love the most are implementing fresh ideas, solving problems, the open source philosophy and the hacker way of life. I love writing code, particularly for systems that interact with the real world.
After graduation in 2014, I worked for a year at Thorogood Associates, a Business Intelligence and Analytics company until recently. Subsequently, I worked at Bolt 3D, a successful 3D printing startup based in Chennai.</description>

      <title>Interfacing a Phillips Remote with AVR atmega8</title>

      <description>Ability to control a robot using a remote would be useful. Remotes have the range of roughly a living room. I wanted a robot to just move based on my instructions. This was a very small scale project, as I was just beginning to learn the basics of Robotics.
To learn more on microcontrollers in general, and the AVR series in particular I worked on a project to interface a Phillips remote with atmega 8.</description>

      <title>Low cost USBasp Programmer</title>

      <description>To program any microcontroller, one needs a programmer. So my first project was making a programmer using USBasp proeject. It is an open source programmer, based on V-USB which allows Atmel AVR microcontrollers to be interfaced with a USB. Thats one great thing about AVRs. They are very well supported by open source tools. They also have really comprehensive datasheets. They are therefore a great choice for someone who is just starting out.</description>
