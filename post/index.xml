      <description>Phew! I knew making a good website wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. But I had 0 clue it was this hard. Tl Dr; Its almost as hard as choosing a background for your phone.
You do, of course, have a full right to disagree. After all, even if you are a complete n00b like me in web dev, you must have created your first website in 15 minutes on wordpress. But thats the thing - its easy if you are using something like wordpress.</description>

      <description>The distinction between A type and B type people is real. I know, because for most of my living memory I have been a B Type person. While it might have its own advantages, the danger of being afflicted with laziness or complacence is all the more. Not to mention - you can easily go down the slippery slope of depression. Which then leads to lack of physical movement ( including not leaving your now shabby room for extended lengths of time ), and that feeds into a vicious cycle of wallowing in eternal misery.</description>
