      <description>The distinction between A type and B type people is real. I know, because for most of my living memory I have been a B Type person. While it might have its own advantages, the danger of being afflicted with laziness or complacence is all the more. Not to mention - you can easily go down the slippery slope of depression. Which then leads to lack of physical movement ( including not leaving your now shabby room for extended lengths of time ), and that feeds into a vicious cycle of wallowing in eternal misery.</description>
