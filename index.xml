      <description>Hey guys! I am Brahm.
Mechanical engineer by education and roboticist by interest, things I love the most are implementing fresh ideas, solving problems, the open source philosophy and the hacker way of life. I love writing code, particularly for systems that interact with the real world.
After graduation in 2014, I worked for a year at Thorogood Associates, a Business Intelligence and Analytics company until recently. Subsequently, I worked at Bolt 3D, a successful 3D printing startup based in Chennai.</description>

      <description>Ability to control a robot using a remote would be useful. Remotes have the range of roughly a living room. I wanted a robot to just move based on my instructions. This was a very small scale project, as I was just beginning to learn the basics of Robotics.
To learn more on microcontrollers in general, and the AVR series in particular I worked on a project to interface a Phillips remote with atmega 8.</description>

      <description>To program any microcontroller, one needs a programmer. So my first project was making a programmer using USBasp proeject. It is an open source programmer, based on V-USB which allows Atmel AVR microcontrollers to be interfaced with a USB. Thats one great thing about AVRs. They are very well supported by open source tools. They also have really comprehensive datasheets. They are therefore a great choice for someone who is just starting out.</description>
